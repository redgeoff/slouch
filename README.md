An API for CouchDB that does the heavy lifting


## Slouch is a good alternative to nano as:

  - You don't have to create an instance for each DB
  - Supports native promises
  - Supports iterators
  - Automatically throttles connections to DB to avoid max_dbs_open errors
  - Automatically persists connections with exponential backoff in case DB restarts or connection is dropped
  - Works in node and in the browser
  - Provides upserts and "get and update" functions
  - Support for optionally ignoring conflicts, missing docs, etc...
  - Designed for both CouchDB 1 and CouchDB 2


## Install

    $ npm install couch-slouch
